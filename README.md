# Nations Assets

this package contains translated message to use out of the box , no need to add them any more
example

```dart
final message = 'login'.tr
print(message);
```

also you did't add `login` message in your assets and translate it to the your supported languages
it will use the nation assets and gets you the correct translated message
if the `MaterialApp` `locale` is arabic it will be `تسجيل الدخول` and if the locale is `English` it will be `Sign In` any so on out of the box

# does this means i can't override the `login` keyword ?

no the package will use the default values only if you don't have one in you assets so you can override it any time

# does this package have a big data sets ? - Will This Make The App very big ?

no this package will contains the necessary and the common keywords sings use in Authentication , Validation , searching , Filtering , introductions , ...etc and will be added manually to choses carefully
which means you gonna support more languages out of the box in the entire app

# Usage

## simple translation

you can use the `.tr` extension or `tr()` function directly

```dart
'key'.tr
// or
tr('key')
```

## Gender

### Male

```dart
// male
'key'.trMale
// or
trMale('key')
```

### Female

```dart
// male
'key'.trFemale
// or
trFemale('key')
```

### use the default gender

```dart
  /// * translate a text **AND** use the default gender
  'key'.gender
  gender('key')
```

## translation attributes

```dart
  'key'.args(args)
  trWithArgs('key',args)

```

## plural

```dart
  'key'.plural(count,args)
  trPlural('key',count,args)

```

# Package Integration Example with `queen_validators`

![example](https://github.com/maxzod/nations/blob/testing/images/example_with_queen_validators.png)

# why make it like this ?

- this will make packages takes control of the localization which will spare the developer of this responsibility
- like when using a validation package for example the failure message should be automatically localized out of the box !
- would this package prevent the developer to use custom translated messages ? No ,, it will only provide a default values in many languages out of the box !
- would this increase the app size ? No , this will provide the necessary values only

## attributes

which allows to customize the translated message

Example in validation :
Arabic => "الحد الاقصي للحروف 255"
English => "max length is 255"

255 is the max length and might changes some times is 255 or 55 or just 2 depend on the form
how to achieve that in nations ?

```json
"max_length_is":"max length is :count"
```

and in your code

```dart
final msg = 'max_length_is'.args({"count":255});
```

for now the generations is not done yet after we finish them no
more String keys and dynamic parameters every thing will be hard type and stricter to avoid future bugs

# Helpers

- [x] `capitalizeFirstChar(String)` to make the first word capital
- [x] `capitalizeEachWord` to make every word capital in one line more entire paragraph
- [ ] `numberToLocale(String,[Locale?])` localize numbers based on locale
